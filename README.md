0x1D. C - Binary trees

I completed this project with the sole objective of understanding the how different types oof understanding how the different tree data structures operate.

In the project i imlemented Basic Binary Tree,, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, and Max Binary Heap. 

Genral learning objectives

What is a binary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
